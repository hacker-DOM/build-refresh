{br} is an {alf} workflow . 

## Installation 
. Clone the repository
. Double-click on `build-refresh.alfredworkflow` and import it into Alfred
. By default, the workflow uses "Hyper" and "Vivaldi" as the termianl and browser, respectively. If you use different applications, you can change these keywords in the different cells. Each cell has a description that includes info on whether or not it should be changed.

## Dependencies
Requires the Alfred Powerpack.

## Project setup
You probably want to have a `build.sh` script. You also want to have a `build-open.sh` which functions as a fallback in case somebody _doesn't_ have {br}.

### build-open.sh

For example, with `asciidoctor-pdf`, your `build-open.sh` could look like this:

[source,bash]
----
./build.sh "$@";
open *.pdf;
----

or, for `asciidoctor` (with html output), you could use:

[source,bash]
----
./build.sh "$@";
open *.html;
----

### build-refresh.sh
Finally, you can add a `build-refresh.sh` that uses this workflow:

[source,bash]
----
# This script requires the Alfred workflow `com.alfredapp.hacker-dom.build-refresh`.
# It can be downloaded from https://github.com/hacker-DOM/build-refresh
# Alfred is a productivity tool for MacOS.
# If you don't have Alfred or this workflow you can just use ./build-open.sh
./build.sh "$@";
/usr/bin/osascript -e "tell application \"Alfred 4\" to run trigger \"refresh\" in workflow \"com.alfredapp.hacker-dom.build-refesh\"";
----

## Usage
There are multiple ways to use the workflow:

. Anywhere in your operating system, launch Alfred (default Cmd+Space), type `build` and execute the `build` trigger of this workflow. The only requirement here is that in your most-recently-used terminal window, the AsciiDoc project is the first tab (more specifically, activatable by Cmd+1).
+
This trigger will run `./build-refresh.sh` in the first tab of your most-recently-used terminal window.
. Alternatively, your can use run `build-refresh.sh` directly.

Either way, this will run the trigger `refresh`. This will use Vivaldi's Api to search its tabs and find one matching one of the following two regexs

[.text-center]
`/^file:\/\/\/Users\/.*\.pdf$/`

[.text-center]
`/^file:\/\/\/Users\/.*\.html$/`

It will then:
. activate that tab
. activate that window
. raise Vivaldi
. activate Vivaldi
. send Cmd+R to refresh the page ðŸš€

## FAQ

> Can I use a Safari?

Safari has a different Api and is currently _not_ supported

> Something doesn't work!

Submit an issue! I'd like this workflow to work on all Chromium-browsers, terminals, etc.
